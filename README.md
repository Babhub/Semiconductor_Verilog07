# Semiconductor_Verilog07
 7) a. wrote a Verilog module for a parametrizable n-bit wide x 2^M deep Register file with the follow module port signature. 
 Constructed a testbench for our design module that displays the stimulus results and generates a waveform to review the results

7) b. Wrote a Verilog module for an 8-bit x 8-deep LIFO stack with the following module port signature. Constructed a testbench for our design module that displays the stimulus results and generates a waveform to review the results

7) c. Wrote a Verilog module for a parametrizable N-bit wide x M-bit deep Synchronous FIFO with the following module port signature and constructed a testbench for our design module that displays the stimulus results and generates a waveform to review the results
